In this problem there's given a chiphertext and encryption algorithm, our flag is encrypted by this algorithm.
To solve this problem we make to build e decryption algorithm and decrypt our flag.

 >> Here's the given encryption algorithm:
	flag = "mehedi hasan"

	encrypted_flag = ''.join(
    	[chr((ord(flag[i]) << 8) + ord(flag[i + 1]))
    	 for i in range(0, len(flag), 2)])
	print(encrypted_flag)


 >> And, here's the decryption algorithm that I build,

	dec = '灩捯䍔䙻ㄶ形楴獟楮獴㌴摟潦弸彥ㄴㅡて㝽'
	encode = ''

	for j in range(0, len(dec)):
    	dec_value = ord(dec[j])
    	for i in range(48, 123, 1):
        	first_char_dec = dec_value - i
        	first_char = (first_char_dec >> 8)
        	if first_char >= 48 and first_char <= 122:
            	encode = encode + chr(first_char)
            	value2 = (first_char << 8)
            	second_char = dec_value - value2
            	encode = encode + chr(second_char)
            	break
	print(encode)
